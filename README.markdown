## Description
This shell script is able to download music from http://www.soundcloud.com.
It has been tested on iOS, OS X, Linux.

## System requirements
* Unix like OS
* curl

## Instructions
* apply executable permissions ```chmod +x ./soundcloud.sh```
* usage: ```soundcloud_curl.sh [TRACK(S) URL]``` or ```soundcloud_new.sh [USER URL]```
